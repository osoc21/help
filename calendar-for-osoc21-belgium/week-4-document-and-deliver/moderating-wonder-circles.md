Make sure that you include the room name of Wonder in your Pitch. Some have been altered because they were too long!

## Get Ready as a Team & Divide work

During the breakout sessions, the team is present in the breakout room to welcome visitors, show off their work and answer questions \(just like in a live edition where they'd come to your booth!\).  
  
Make sure the roles are divided, and you know who is present for what at all times. Big teams; take turns to make sure enough people can enter! The limit is set to 15 people per room.

_This is a chance for you to present yourself to future employers, meet like-minded people and to show people what you've made. Use it as an opportunity_ üòä

{% hint style="info" %}
Moderating can get quite heavy; so you can definitely split up tasks over your team members and coach\(es\)!
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Test your mics together ‚ù§Ô∏è
{% endhint %}

## Pick a Noise Moderator

Politely ask people to turn off their microphones unless they want to ask questions; to reduce noise.

If everybody starts talking at the same time, _you're gonna have a bad time_. Only the person speaking should have their microphone on, on their turn. Your team members can manage their own microphone.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Start Off Quiet ‚Äì** it's easier to do it at the start.  
****Prepare a little text you can copy-paste when needed \(when new people enter the room\), or turn on your own mic to ask!
{% endhint %}

## Set the Stage

1. Make sure everyone knows what will happen during the breakout session; and what is expected of them. Prepare a slide to welcome everyone, and outline the rules.
   1. If people are shy, you can add example questions to the chat!
2. Share your contact details in the end! Network mode üî•

## Pick a Master of Ceremony to Welcome People

Make sure people feel welcome in your temporary home!

* Welcome everyone!
* Motivate visitors to ask questions in the chat
  * Ask visitors to come on screen with the team and turn on their mic while answering the question.
* Add suggestions, invite team members to show a demo, share websites, ...

## Pick Who Will Show the Demo, a Website, ...?

Multiple people can take on this role, but the most important part is that you made good agreements about it.

## Pick a Question Moderator

The Master of Ceremony might need some backup while answering questions, especially if there's a lot of people in there.

### Keep an eye on questions

A lot of questions coming in? Help out the host.

* Pick interesting and bundle similar questions
* Give the hosts a heads up on:
  * which question is going to be answered
  * who posed the question \(and thus who to invite to the screen with mic\)
  * who will answer the question \(the team member that can answer; this is especially useful in bigger teams\)

#### How to delegate

Pick how, just make sure your team knows in advance!

1. Use the DM function in Wonder
2. Or use discord
