## Last Partner Meeting

### How

On Tuesdays we wear pink.. I mean meet clients.

There's time in the morning to prepare your client meetings, if you didn't do that already the day before! To keep in mind for your first meeting:

1. [ ] Present your team members \(students and coaches\)
2. [ ] Check if you understood all needs and goals \(you can reuse the pitch you made on day 1\)
3. [ ] List all the questions you have
4. [ ] Decide who does the talking
5. [ ] Decide who takes notes

Some tips and tricks can come in handy if you've never attended a client meeting before:
