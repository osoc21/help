## Client meetings

### How

On Tuesdays we wear pink.. I mean meet clients.

There's time in the morning to prepare your client meetings, if you didn't do that already the day before! To keep in mind for your first meeting:

1. [ ] Present your team members \(students and coaches\)
2. [ ] Check if you understood all needs and goals \(you can reuse the pitch you made on day 1\)
3. [ ] List all the questions you have
4. [ ] Decide who does the talking
5. [ ] Decide who takes notes

Some tips and tricks can come in handy if you've never attended a client meeting before:

## Pick your Talk

### \[optional workshop 1\] Collaborating between Design and Dev by Niels

Go to [**Workshops & Talks**](../../workshops-and-talks.md) and find this one and other interesting ones there!

### \[optional workshop 2\] Data Prototyping in Notion by Thor

Thor, an osoc alumni that has made some _niiiiice_ projects with us has a very low-entry way of prototyping data in Notion. It'll help your team think about what they need \(what data, database structure, ...\) _before_ they start building things for human beings.
