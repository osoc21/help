## Pick your Talk

### \[optional workshop 1\] Collaborating between Design and Dev by Niels & \[optional workshop 2\] Atomic Design by Niels

Two very interesting talks by our Swag Manager for designers & devs alike; and probably anyone in the team circling around them.

Learn how to function better with these two short talks as a team.

### \[optional workshop 3\] Data Prototyping in Notion by Thor

Thor, an osoc alumni that has made some _niiiiice_ projects with us has a very low-entry way of prototyping data in Notion. It'll help your team think about what they need \(what data, database structure, ...\) _before_ they start building things for human beings.
