## "What project will I be building this year?"

Can't wait, and want to prep in the meantime? Study the resources!

## Join us on Discord, and get to know everyone ❤

For this second fully remote edition, we hang out in Discord. Come say hi, we'd love to welcome you!

After you’ve created an account, please carefully read Miet's how-to-get-started message in the `#welcome` channel. All of you will be tagged in the specific Discord channel for your project.

## **Be there on Monday 09:00** _**sharp**_

We'd like to ask you to be online \(on Discord\) between 08:30 and 09:00 on Monday 5 July. At 9:00 _sharp_ we’ll start with our opening presentation.

The first day is mainly an introduction day to get to know your teammates, coach, project and other teams. Many of you are new to open summer of code and that makes it super exciting.

Look at the [**calendar**](calendar-for-osoc21-belgium/) to discover what we'll be doing in the next days.

## **Invite Your Friends to the Demo Day**

**Tell your friends and family to block their agenda on Thursday 29 July \(13:00 to 16:00\).**

On the last day of \#osoc21, we’re going to present our projects to the general public! Our Demo Day will take place via live streaming and will be open to everyone.
