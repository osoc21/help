* When the Mozilla Foundation created Open Badges, they also wrote [this whitepaper. ](https://wiki.mozilla.org/images/5/59/OpenBadges-Working-Paper_012312.pdf)
* In the Netherlands, SURF used the concept of Open Badges and created Edubadges. Read about their experience and findings [here. ](https://www.surf.nl/whitepaper-open-badges-en-microcredentialing)
